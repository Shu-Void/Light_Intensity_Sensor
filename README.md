# Light_Intensity_Sensor

This project utilises an LDR (Light dependant resistor) to measure the amount of light  at a ceratin time and uploading it to the cloud via esp 8266 wifi module(by BOLT IOT). Then, plotting it using HTML programming. 

It has various applications such as:
1) Automatic Lighting Control: Light intensity sensors are used in automatic lighting systems to adjust the brightness of lights based on the ambient light level. For example, they can be employed in streetlights to turn them on/off or dim them according to the natural light available.
2) Security Systems: Light intensity sensors are integral components of security systems, where they can detect changes in light levels to trigger alarms or activate surveillance cameras. They are used in both indoor and outdoor security setups.
3) Energy Conservation: In buildings, light intensity sensors can contribute to energy conservation by controlling the usage of artificial lighting. They can detect the presence of natural light and adjust the brightness of electric lights accordingly, reducing energy consumption.
4) Greenhouse Automation: Light intensity sensors play a crucial role in greenhouse automation by monitoring natural sunlight levels and controlling artificial lighting to optimize plant growth conditions. They ensure that plants receive the required amount of light for photosynthesis.
5) Weather Monitoring: Light intensity sensors are utilized in weather stations to measure solar radiation. This data helps in understanding weather patterns, studying climate change, and forecasting atmospheric conditions.
6) Photography and Imaging: In photography, light intensity sensors assist in exposure metering, ensuring that the correct amount of light reaches the camera sensor for well-exposed images. They are also used in imaging systems for quality control and calibration purposes.
